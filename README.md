# Error-CorrectingAlgorithms

This project serves as a comprehensive testing ground for two prominent error detection techniques: Hamming Code and CRC-32. The repository showcases an end-to-end implementation, involving both Java and Python, to simulate the transmission and reception of binary frames.

For more in-depth information, please refer to the comprehensive report available within the repository.

### Instructions

To run the program correctly, you must have configured an environment or environments that are capable of running python and java. For part 1 of laboratory 2, regardless of which is executed first, you can see how the algorithms work.

For the second part of lab 2, it is necessary to run the .py file first and then one of the two .java files, either the automated one or the manual direct message one.
